---- To doo

- Add objects (simple : only comp bonus)

Items :

1 scaffold : Item code:string default_translation:string price:integer apparition_odd:integer bonuses:string (serialized field)
1 hbtm class : investigators_items (see if can change hbtm table name) - investigator has item
1 hbtm class : items_places - place can have item
1 model : ItemsOnBoard game_board:references place:references item:references
- add shop:boolean to Place

At begining of each turn : place n items on the shops (max 4 items per shop)
 - only on shop that has shop = true
 - take care of items_places

Each time a investigator goe to a shop he has the action buy, with this action he can buy item(s) regarding his money

Each item buff or unbuff one or more caracs.
- Before making a test, we check all the buffs of the items for that carac and we take the max.
- We do the same for the unbuff and we check the min.
- We compute current carac + buff + unbuff and we then make the test.
- A carac can't be lower than 1.

--

- Add salary (given each turn directly to investigator)
- Influence allow to negotiate prices : 5% rebate per success (max 50%)

- Add taxis : allow 3 moves in one. Must pay for that, but influence can negotiate the price.
 - This is a random event (10% chance)

- Remove actions that are unavaliable.
